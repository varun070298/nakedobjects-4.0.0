				<release version="3.0.1" date="unreleased" description="Bug fixes">

						<action dev="rcmatthews" type="add">
								All types of Java collections can now be used, specifically Sets. (408)
						</action>

						<action dev="scascarini" type="add">
								Made database authenticator more configurable by moving (optional) SQL into properties
								and allowing algorithm to be switched off or changed
						</action>

						<action dev="scascarini" type="fix">
								Bug 418: Fixtures always run against PostgreSQL database - fix by checking both upper

						</action>

						<action dev="scascarini" type="fix">
								Made bounded objects in expenses DOM immutable so users cannot edit them
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="add">
								Replaced the TransientObjectStore with InMemoryObjectStore. This stores the POJOs rather
								than the adapters and hence work more like an persisting object store as the objects are
								retrieved from memory and adapters are created for them. This is particularly important
								when fixtures are run and the system is reset before running. (422)
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="fix">
								Transient border now recursively works through views checking for valid fields. (423)
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="fix">
								All adapters now handle the empty state consistently and with out throwing NPE. (413)
								Have reviewed and consolidated the parsing, encoding and decoding of adapter values.
						</action>

						<action dev="scascarini" action="fix">
								Bug 420 Hib OS: ConcurrentListModification in Hibernate when deployed via Tomcat (works
								okay in Jetty). Fixed by removing pre and post flush interceptors that update resolving
								state (to and from serializing).
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="fix">
								Blank lines are now ignored in password files, and invalid entries are flagged. (425)
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="fix">
								HTML page builder now has a default title so every page is guaranteed to display with a
								title. (425)
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="fix">
								Choices method for properties can now be lists or arrays. (426)
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="fix">
								Choices drop down on value fields now show the selection that was made. (426)
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="fix">
								Collection views, when updated, no longer remove duplicated elements. (415)
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="fix">

								decorator is used. (416)

								(in HTML and DND). (111)
						</action>

						<action dev="scascarini" action="fix">
								Refactored web code to be independent of servlet implmentation classes for ASP.NET port
						</action>

						<action dev="rcmatthews" action="fix">
								Objects that are destroyed are flaged as such (with a ResolveState of DESTROYED) and any
								root views are removed from DND UI. (417)

								When actions are execute remotely, or locally and changes are passed to the server, the
								set of objects that has been disposed is passed back to the client so it can remove the
								views of the disposed objects.
